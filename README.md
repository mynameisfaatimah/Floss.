## General Information
This is a platform that addresses dental anxiety by providing information about dental procedures, treatments, and symptoms. This also offers tools to manage anxiety. With my previous experience in the dental field I found that patients struggle with anxiety and PTSD associated with dental treatments. Dental care is crucial to overall health and so, anxiety and not understanding treatments should be just a hurdle and not a deterreant from getting the care needed.

## Acknowledgements
Give credit here.
- This project was inspired by Dr. Kabani. Her ability to gain her patients trust, display of compassion and understanding helped a lot of people get the care they needed. The simpliest gestures like taking the time to explain treatments and allowing patients to brace themselves before begininning treatments or allowing them to gain their compsure by taking breaks went a long way.
